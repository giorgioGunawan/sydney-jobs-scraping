# sydney-jobs-scraping

## About
Scrapes jobs from two biggest sites namely Indeed and Seek for jobs in Sydney NSW and presents it at https://jobs-scrape-dashboard.herokuapp.com/. 
This project uses web scraping to quickly obtain information without integrating multiple APIs. The data can also be seen in google sheet form: bit.ly/jobs-scrape.
The code that links the google sheet form to the website can be found in https://github.com/giorgioGunawan/reactAndGoogleSheets.

## Usage
There are 3 spiders. 2 of them are actual spiders called "indeed-spider" and "seek-spider" which expects a CLI argument "user_input".
The other spider is a dummy spider "reset-spider" which resets the database and clears all data. The CLI argument "user_input" expects the job title in a specific format.
It is important that the string in user_input uses '+' instead of spaces. 

- Using the indeed spider to find graduate software engineer jobs
```
> scrapy crawl 'indeed-spider' -a user_input="graduate+software+engineer"
```

- Using the seek spider to find school teacher jobs
```
> scrapy crawl 'seek-spider' -a user_input="school+teacher"
```

- Using the reset dummy spider to reset database
```
> scrapy crawl 'reset-spider'
```
